# BRK453 Exploring cutting-edge models: LLMs, SLMs, local development and more


## Session Desciption
Today, there are many Generative AI models to choose from: Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), proprietary models, open models, models in the cloud, models on devices, text models, code models, image models, and multimodal models. In this session, we'll provide guidance to help you choose the right model to fit your needs, and tools you can use to evaluate and compare models for your specific tasks.

### Breakout Abstract:
There are many Generative AI models: LLMs, SLMs, proprietary, open, cloud-based, on-device, text, code, image, and multimodal. Learn how to choose the right model for your needs and about tools to evaluate and compare models for specific tasks.
 
### Duration: 
45 minutes

## Learning Outcomes
 
### Understanding of Generative AI Models:
Attendees should leave with a clear understanding of what generative AI models are, how they work, and their significance in various applications.
### Model Selection Criteria:
Participants will learn how to choose the right model for specific tasks based on factors such as task requirements, model capabilities, and performance metrics.
### Awareness of Model Types:
Weâ€™ll explore different types of generative models, including Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3, Small Language Models (SLMs), and multimodal models that handle text, code, and images.
### Fine-Tuning Techniques:
Attendees will see how fine-tuning can improve model performance and adapt it to specific use cases.
### Evaluation and Comparison Tools:
Weâ€™ll discuss industry-standard evaluation metrics and tools like Azure Machine Learning for accurate model measurement.
### Real-World Case Studies:
Examples of successful model applications will provide insights into practical deployment scenarios.
### The Future of Generative AI:
Weâ€™ll wrap up with thoughts on where this field is headed and its potential impact.
