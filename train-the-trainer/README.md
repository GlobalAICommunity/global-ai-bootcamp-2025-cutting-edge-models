code.

## Session overview 

Here is a summary of the selected slides:

### Session Flow:

**Introduction:** Brief overview of Generative AI models and the importance of choosing the right model for specific tasks.

**Types of Generative AI Models:** Discussion on LLMs, SLMs, proprietary vs. open, cloud-based vs. on-device, and multi-modal models. Includes a demo comparing SLMs vs. LLMs and inference using text and vision.

**Common Scenarios and Processes:** Criteria to help guide towards the right model, including task requirements, model capabilities, performance metrics, evaluation methods, iterative refinement, and validation processes. Includes a demo on fine-tuning using local and cloud resources.

**Tools for Model Evaluation and Comparison:** Azure ML for model accuracy measurement, industry-standard evaluation metrics for different model types, and experimentation and validation techniques for model selection.

**Case Studies:** Examples of successful model applications and lessons learned from deployment. Includes a demo of the .NET Aspire RAG Solution.

**Conclusion:** Recap of key points and final thoughts on the future of Generative AI models.

**Session Goals:** Provide a comprehensive understanding of Generative AI models, their types, and the criteria for selecting the right model for specific tasks.

**Demos:** Demonstrate AIâ€™s integration with Azure services, enhancing cloud management and sales engagement.

**Key Audience Takeaways:** Grasp the essentials of Generative AI models, including the importance of model selection for specific tasks and the differences between various model types. Learn about the criteria for choosing the right model and discover tools for model evaluation. Gain real-world insights into model applications and optimization techniques through case studies.
