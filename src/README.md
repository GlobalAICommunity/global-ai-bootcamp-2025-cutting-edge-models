# Getting Started with Demo Source Code

## Overview of Demos
This repository contains sample code for the AI Tour Session - Exploring Cutting Edge Models. Each demo folder has a README file with more details. Additional demo videos will be available for use in PowerPoint presentations if live demos are not possible.

## Setting Up the Environment Using Codespaces
We have provided a complete Codespaces environment in the repository. You can also download the devcontainer for local installation by clicking on the devcontainer link.

### Codespace Environment:

- 32 Core CPU
- 128GB of Memory

**Note:** Please wait for Codespaces to initialize and for the setup scripts to complete. We are downloading and installing LLM and SLM models directly to Codespaces, so it may take some time.
